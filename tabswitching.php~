<!--This is the tab switching Script

Working : In this user have two chances to move from the tab after that it will show disqualified .

1. Firefox : User have two chances to move when user will return on that tab it will show an alert message like that 'It was your first time to switch' . After third attempt it will show an alert message like that 'Sorry You are disqualified '.

2. Chrome : Same as Firefox

3. IE : Same as Firefox

So Firefox, Chrome and IE are showing same type of behaviour.

4. Opera : Opera is nearly same as above all but when an alert box shows then you need to click back on the window to get the focus. All the other things are working same .
